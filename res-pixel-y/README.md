I was originally considering using the pixelated (downsampled) images in this folder instead of
the full resolution images, because it felt like it would fit better with the asthetic.

I decided eventually that these super high quality awesome looking skyboxes would not fit well
with the asthetic no matter what, and just used the full resolution ones because they look
really really cool.
